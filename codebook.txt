
1. Study Design

	Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
	Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
	wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the 
	Human Activity Recognition team captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant 
	rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was 
	selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
	
	A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

		http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


	The R script run_analysis.R performs the following: 

		1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
		2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
		3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
		4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

		From the data set in step 4, an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
		and each subject is created.
